# 📚 Semantic Book Recommender with LLMs
This project leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vector Databases to build a recommendation engine that understands the meaning behind book descriptions. 

🌟 Key Features
* Semantic Search: Find books by describing a plot, a feeling, or a specific topic in natural language.

* Vectorized Knowledge: Uses OpenAI Embeddings to transform text into high-dimensional mathematical vectors.

* Metadata Enrichment: Search results include rich data such as ISBN, publication year, and author information.
